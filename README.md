# EECS 111

These are recitation notes for EECS 111, Fall 2016 at Northwestern University. Notes are *not* comprehensive, and generally only posted for particularly important or confusing topics.

Recitation is held **every Sunday** at **7:00pm** in **Tech LR4**. It is entirely optional, directed at first-time programmers, and structured as a mini-lecture with ample time for questions.
