# EECS 111

These are recitation notes for EECS 111, Fall 2016 at Northwestern University. These notes are not comprehensive. I generally only post notes for particularly important or confusing topics.

Recitation is held **every Sunday** at **7:00pm** in **Tech LR4**. It is entirely optional, directed at first-time programmers, and structured as a mini-lecture with ample time for questions.

## Agenda

| October 23 | Quiz 1 Review | |
